# Widget Simmulator (Final Portfolio)

### Description

Create a webpage that simmulates a mobile or desktop layout with apps and widgets

For this project we will be using react to componentize all our vanilla javascript projects, and laravel to add all of our react components to a home screen where users can decide what to click on.

### MVP

By default, the app should show off your projects and exercises in a clean and concise format, and be able to be re-arranged in the code to create different layouts

#### Wireframe

![wireframe](../wireframes/mobile-widgets.png)
![wireframe](../wireframes/desktop-widgets.png)

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Process

##### Setup:

1. Create repo, for example: `my-app`
2. Locally, navigate to your `sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name` into your Sites folder
4. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
5. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
6. Save all and create your first commit to `master`

###### Application File Structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        /style.css - stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        /main.js
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

##### Develop:

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Post links to your GitHub repo to the Projects and Exercises Slack channel

### Requirements

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Componentize each vanilla JS project with the following additional requirements:
   - Clock and Countdown Timer will be one component with a prop that says which view to display, and a prop that is the start button for the countdown timer
   -
2. Requirement 2
3. Requirement 3

#### Additional Requirements

- Website must be responsive
- Style your app as you wish
- Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources).
- Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
  - _**Remember to push to GitHub!**_
  - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

#### Stretch Goals

- stretch goal 1
- stretch goal 2
- stretch goal 3

#### If you finish early...

1. Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
3. Add links and resources from this week to the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources) by forking the repo and then initiating a pull request with your additions to the .md file.
