# Campaign Website

### Description

Create a website promoting your favorite _FICTIONAL_ character from a book, TV show, movie, or graphic novel, who is running for the elected position of Constable in your magistrate district of Fayette County. (There are 3 such districts.)

Briefly research the role of Constable, then design a political website for your chosen character. [Here's a link to get you started](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constables_in_the_United_States#Kentucky)

Your job is to make it easy for voters to see whether your candidate's beliefs align with their own.
To keep things light and fun, pick issues that pertain to the character in their fictional setting, not the real world. :-)

### MVP

By default, the app should show potential voters who the candiate is and have lots of different content; view the [Requirements](#Requirements) for more

#### Wireframe

![wireframe](../wireframes/campaign-website.jpg)

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS

### Process

##### Setup:

1. Create repo, for example: `my-app`
2. Locally, navigate to your `sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name` into your Sites folder
4. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
5. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
6. Save all and create your first commit to `master`

###### Application File Structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        /style.css - stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

##### Develop:

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Post links to your GitHub repo to the Projects and Exercises Slack channel
